## Learning circle team template

This is a template site for creating sub sites for learning circle. It was built for other language learning circle communities. As such, the aim is to provide a complete set of tools + info for learners to participate in learning circles without needing to translate all P2PU materials.

This template can also be used in cases where learning circles need to be contextualized for a specific audience.
